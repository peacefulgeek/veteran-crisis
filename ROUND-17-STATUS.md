# Round 17 — BacklinkWebsites Final Pass: Status Report

Generated: 2026-05-28

## Summary

The Veteran Crisis (veterancrisis.com) has completed the BacklinkWebsites Final Pass. All public-facing content reads from Bunny CDN with no database on the hot path. Article generation is now Claude-first with a deterministic fallback chain. AI/LLM discoverability files are live for 25 named crawlers. The published library spans the prior 90 days with 34 articles and a 466-article queue ready for daily publication.

## Status Table

| Area | Status | Detail |

## Operator actions required

1. **Add `CLAUDE_API_KEY` to Railway environment variables.** The sandbox has it; production article generation will fall back to OpenAI/template until Railway is updated.
2. Optional: purge Bunny edge cache for fresh content (`scripts/purge-bunny-edge-cache.mjs` requires `BUNNY_ACCOUNT_API_KEY`).
